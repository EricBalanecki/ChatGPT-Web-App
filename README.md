# GPT Web App

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a web application designed for both desktop and mobile platforms, built using Java, HTML, and Flask. It showcases a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. 

The goal for this project was to learn simple web development, databases, and authentatication that can be applied to future projects. Furthermore, I also wanted to explore moire about intergrating API's into my project.
Currently, I am integrating the openAI API to create simple chatbots and plan to remap the GUI using Next.js in the future.
